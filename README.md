# Fake News Detection

## Overview  
The topic of fake news detection on social media has recently attracted tremendous attention. The basic countermeasure of comparing websites against a list of labeled fake news sources is inflexible, and so a machine learning approach is desirable.  Our project aims to use Natural Language Processing to detect fake news directly, based on the text content of news articles. 

## Problem Definition
Develop a tool that uses machine learning algorithms to identify and flag misleading or fabricated news articles from online sources. The system should analyze text content, verify sources, and provide users with credibility scores.

## Features  
Created a Website showing Real Time News and in real time , ML model assigns a reliability % score and colored shield based on whether news is real or fake . 
User can search for any news article by pasting its url in the search box . User will see the title and short summary of the article and  a reliability % score and determine whether the news article is real or fake . 

Here are some key features of the Website :

### Basic User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)
