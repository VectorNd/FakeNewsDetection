## 🌟 Overview  
This project was developed as a submission for **Microsoft AI Hackathon 2024**. With the rapid spread of misinformation on social media, detecting fake news has become critical. Traditional approaches, like maintaining lists of fake news sources, are inflexible.  

Our project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to analyze the text content of news articles and determine their credibility.
